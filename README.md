# OS_3
During the task this readme will contain comments on what we have done, what we need to fix and so on.
DONT FORGET -> upload commits to branches.

what we have:

part A probably done.

ipv4_tcp -> almost done.

ipv4_udp -> done.


lidor: just need to make the ipv4_tcp give the correct hash.

gal: create ipv6 tcp and udp -> look at my code how i have done it (just take the idea).
     use chatgpt to get the network connection and take from my code the idea of the poll function and how i have worked with it.


dont change each other's code.


after commiting to a branch update this readme.
